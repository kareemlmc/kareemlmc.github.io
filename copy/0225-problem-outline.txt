PROBLEM
- What is their problem?  What have they tried that's not worked?

You're the domain expert.  You've worked with developers in the past but something always gets lost in translation and you never get exactly what you want.  They talk in code; you talk in terms of your business and its problems.

You're left in the dark while your developers go away and code for weeks or months. When they pull the curtain off your product, it might be close to what you want, but it's never exactly right.

Getting business results is hard because you're not really sure what developers need to build you what you want.

AMPLIFY
- What are consequences of not solving this problem?

You're frustrated.  You need to get your product out there to take advantage of a market opportunity, but you can't find developers you trust who can help your business grow by delivering the product you need.

You spend days, weeks, or maybe months looking for a developer who seems like they "get it" and who it won't be difficult to work with.  This is time - and money - you're losing when your product isn't out there being used by customers.


“S” is for STORY and SOLUTION
- Be very specific - not just "Bob figured out the solution" -- take them on the journey.  Must be true.

Take John.  He was a domain expert and saw a problem and huuuge opportunity.  The market was moving quickly, and John needed to take advantage of this rapidly closing window -- fast.  He wasn't a developer, and didn't know many reliable developers who could translate his complex vision into a product that people would use.

“T” is for TRANSFORMATION and TESTIMONY
- Has this person been able to do what they are describing for themselves?
- Has this person been able to teach other people to achieve the results they are describing?
- Will this person be able to teach me how to achieve these results?

John hired us to help translate his vision into a business.  Fast-forward six years, and the product that was literally an idea when we were brought on is now a team of 40 that's done $80M in revenue.

We helped John identify the market needs and ideal customers, honed in on the right solution, built, and helped hire a killer development team to maintain and grow the product.

John is on his way to building a huge business.

“O” is for OFFER
- “Here’s Exactly What You Get.”
- Make certain that you focus 80% of your copy on the transformation itself. You do have to talk about the deliverables (the class schedule, the DVDs, etc.), but that should only occupy about 20% of your copy in this section.
- Just remember that as you describe the deliverables in the offer section, you must keep tying them back to the transformation and benefits your buyers will receive.

Here's what you get when you work with us:

1. We'll start by understanding your business's context: what the market is, who your ideal customer is, what their problems and motivations are, and what the solution could be.

2. We'll ideally interview to some customers to deep dive into the problem they're having and how to provide a solution.

3. We'll translate your data and customers into product wireframes for you to review.  We work iteratively so you can provide insight as we go.

4. Once wireframes are approved, we'll build out key product features.  We work in short iterations -- one or two weeks -- so you can provide feedback to inform the next set of features.

5. Once the product is done, we'll make sure reports are set up so you can measure key business metrics.

6. Finally, we'll transition the product to your internal team, or maintain it for you while you hire a team.
