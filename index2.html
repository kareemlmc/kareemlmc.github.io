              <p>You're the domain expert.  You've worked with developers in the past but something always gets lost in translation. You never get exactly what you want.  They talk in code; you talk in terms of your business and its problems.</p>

              <p>You're left in the dark while your developers go away and code for weeks or months. When they pull the curtain off your product, it might be close to what you want, but it's never exactly right.</p>

              <p>You're frustrated.  You need to get your product out there to take advantage of a market opportunity, but you can't find developers you trust who can help your business grow by delivering the product you need.

              <p>You've spent days, weeks, or maybe months looking for a developer who seems like they "get it" and who it won't be difficult to work with.  It's hard to tell, because they use technical terms that don't make a lot of sense to you.  This is time - and money - you're losing when your product isn't out there being used by customers.

              <p>John is a domain expert who runs an offline business.  He saw a problem and huuuge opportunity in his domain.  The market was moving quickly, and John needed to take advantage of this rapidly closing window -- fast.  He wasn't a developer, and didn't know many reliable developers who could translate his complex vision into a product that people would use.
              </p>

              <p>But John found us: two guys who can talk about your business, learn what product needs to be built, and then go write the darn code ourselves.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-2">
              <p>John hired us to help translate his vision into a business.  Fast-forward six years, and the product that was literally an idea when we were brought on is now a team of 40 that's done $80M in revenue.  </p>

              <p>We helped John identify the market need and ideal customers, honed in on the right solution, sourced and hired a killer development team to build it alongside us and to maintain it after our work was done. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-2">
              <p>Here's exactly what you get when you work with us.</p>

              <p><strong>Understand your market</strong><br>We'll start by understanding your business's context: what the market is, who your ideal customer is, what their problems and motivations are, and what the solution could be.</p>

              <p><strong>Customer research</strong><br>We'll ideally interview some customers to deep dive into the problem they're having what a good solution looks like.</p>

              <p><strong>Mockups</strong><br>We'll translate your vision and the  customer interview data into product mockups for you to review.  We don't start coding until you think the mockups make sense.</p>

              <p><strong>Build and iterate</strong><br>Once the mockups are approved, we'll build out key product features.  We work in short iterations -- usually two weeks -- so you can provide feedback to inform the next set of features.</p>

              <p><strong>Set up reporting</strong><br>Once the product is done, we'll make sure reports are set up so you can measure key business metrics.</p>

              <p><strong>Handoff the product</strong><br>Finally, we'll transition the product to your internal team, or maintain it for you while you hire a team.  All your code is robust, tested, and maintanable.  Plus, we're available to help your team so the transition is as painless as possible.</p>
