                <p>You have an idea for an app that will help your business grow faster.</p>

                <p>Finding good developers is always a challenge.  Finding good developers who design great products and understand how your business works is even more difficult.  Most developers get excited by technical challenges, not business challenges.</p>

                <p>You know that building exactly what your business needs could have an outsized impact.  But you need someone who understands your business and your customers.  They also need to know how to build good web products, and write code.</p>

                <p>This combination of skills in an experienced team is rare.  It's going to take a lot of time to find those people.</p>

                <p>But every day you spend looking is one more day not spent taking advantage of the opportunity you see in the market.</p>

                <p>Your could use your existing team, but you don't want to pull them off building your product and servicing your customers.</p>

                <p>Maybe you've not yet begun to look because it's so daunting.  Or maybe you've spent days, weeks, or even months looking for a team you can trust to deliver without a lot of hand holding. </p>

                <p>Either way, you haven't found the right team to execute.  This is time and money that you're losing when your product isn't out there being used by customers.</p>

                <p>John is a domain expert who ran a successful business.  He saw a problem and huuuge new market opportunity.  The market was moving quickly, and John needed to take advantage of this rapidly closing window -- fast.</p>

                <p>But John's existing development team was working on another product.  And he didn't know any business-focused software teams who could translate his complex vision into a product that people would use.</p>

                <p>Luckily John found us: two guys who learned about his business and customers, helped figure out the product that needed to be built, and then went and built it.</p>

                <p>We helped John identify his customers' key problems, hone in on the right solution, source and hire a talented development team to build it alongside us and to maintain it after our work was done. </p>

          <h2 class="text-center  block-title">What you get when we work together</h2>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-2">
                <p>Here's exactly what you get when you work with us.</p>

                <p>First, you work with us: the founders. We cut our professional teeth building web apps, and we've founded, run, and sold successful software companies. We write code on your product. We may work with talented partners for key pieces of the project if need be, but we're actively building and directing the project the entire way.</p>

                <p>Next, you get a well-defined product development process that gets results.  You benefit from hard-won lessons from over 30 years of shipping profitable software.</p>

                <p>Here's our process:</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">1. Understand your market</h4>
                <p>We'll work with you to understand your business's context: what the market is, who your ideal customer is, what their problems and motivations are, and what the solution could be.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">2. Determine your customers' problems</h4>
                <p>We'll talk to some target customers to deep dive into the problems they're having, and what a good solution looks like.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">3. Mockup potential solutions</h4>
                <p>We'll translate your vision and the customer interview data into product mockups for you to review.  We don't start coding until you think the mockups make sense.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">5. Validate the solution</h4>
                <p>We'll confirm with a set of ideal customers that the mocked up solution would solve their problem.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">5. Build and iterate</h4>
                <p>Once the mockups are validated, we'll build out key product features.  We work in short iterations, usually two weeks.  This is so you're not left in the dark and can provide feedback to inform the next set of features.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">6. Set up reporting</h4>
                <p>Once our product work is done, we'll work with you to identify key business metrics.  We'll make sure reporting is set up so you can track your metrics as your app grows.</p>

                <h4 class="subhead">7. Handoff the product</h4>
                <p>Finally, we'll transition the product to your internal team, or maintain it for you while you hire a team (we can help hire, too).  All your code is robust, tested, and maintanable.  Plus, we're available to help your team so the transition is as painless as possible.</p>
